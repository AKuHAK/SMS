Many people asked me for an SMS hebrew font, so I made it.

latin1.mtf - Hebrew font, BIG and very clear font, even on 14" TV. (Most people here have huge plasma TV now, but I am a poor college student....)
ascii.mtf - This is Mr. Worm bigger ascii font, I use it since my hebrew font is big.

Extra tools only for users using hebrew:
SUBS 1.1 - tool to reverse srt and sub files needed in Hebrew language.
HebMTK - tool to reverse subs needed in Hebrew language. Check only reverse option for most subs.
